Start Docker Server with 2 covereges:
=====================================

1. Run Docker for Windows

2. Go to the folder where you have the Navitia docker git project: ...\navitia-docker-compose

3. run "Git Bash" and type: 
$ git pull

4. Once done Change directory to "\TransitAnalystIsrael\root\assets":
$ cd "C:\Dev\TransitAnalystIsrael\root\assets" 
and type:
$ docker-compose up

Don't close git bash!


5. Once you see all containers started, open Windows Power Shell (not cmd!) - the path is not improtant and type:
docker ps

a list of docker containers should appear, copy the name of the worker container from the NAMES column, e.g. "navitia-docker-compose_tyr_worker_1"

6. Type the following command in the power shell in order to conenct to the worker container:
docker exec -i -t navitia-docker-compose_tyr_worker_1 /bin/bash

7. Once in, type the following commands in order to have 2 coverages as a base setup:
cd /srv/ed/output
cp default.nav.lz4 secondary-cov.nav.lz4
exit()

8. Go back to Git Bash terminal with running log and press CTRL+C to stop the docker container.
If, you closed the bash terminal, re-open it and type:
$ docker stop $(docker ps -a -q)

9. Start docker with 2 covereges by opening a Git Bash terminal at "...\TransitAnalystIsrael\root\assets" and running:
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-israel-custom-instances.yml up

10. Wait 2-3 minutes and then browse to "http://localhost:9191/v1/coverage/default" and "http://localhost:9191/v1/coverage/secondary-cov".
    You should see "start_production_date:" field with an actual date (if you see "dead-socket" wait 1-2 min. more)
