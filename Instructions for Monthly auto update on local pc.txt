0. Set up a PC for local production with TTM - Transit Time Map. see instructions document "Local version setup.txt"
	a. The starting dir structure under TransitAnalystIsrael (the name of this parent dir is not important and can be different) is explained below:
		gtfs 					- GTFS unzipped dir is placed in this dir
		osm 					- Open Street Map file for Israel is downloaded to this dir for the TTM tool
		processed 				- this dir can start out empty, it will hold all the processed data files produced by the python scripts
		root					- this dir holds the python scripts that process the GTFS files about 50 files. 
									See the flows presentation to see how they are used.
		static_data				- this dir holds the 8 or so data files that do not change every month. They are copied into the processed dir before processing starts.
		website_no_data			- this dir holds the client side html and js code for the tools, without the processed data. 
									the files in this dir are copied into the dir website_current together with the processed data to create the tools
		website_current			- this output dir will hold the tools and processed data to display for the current month
		website_past			- this output dir will hold the tools and processed data to display for the past month
