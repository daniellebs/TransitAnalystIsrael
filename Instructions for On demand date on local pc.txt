0. Set up a PC for local production with TTM - Transit Time Map. see instructions document "Set up a PC for local production with Transit Time Map"
	a. The starting dir structure under TransitAnalystIsrael (the name of this parent dir is not important and can be different) is explained below:
		gtfs 					- GTFS unzipped dir is placed in this dir
		osm 					- Open Street Map file for Israel is downloaded to this dir for the TTM tool
		processed 				- this dir can start out empty, it will hold all the processed data files produced by the python scripts
		root					- this dir holds the python scripts that process the GTFS files about 50 files. See the flows presentation to see how they are used.
		static_data				- this dir holds the 8 or so data files that do not change every month. They are copied into the processed dir before processing starts.
		website_no_data			- this dir holds the client side html and js code for the tools, without the processed data. 
									the files in this dir are copied into the on-demand date dir website_yyyymmdd together with the processed data to create the tools

		website_current			- not used in this product. this output dir will hold the tools and processed data to display for the current month
		website_past			- not used in this product. this output dir will hold the tools and processed data to display for the past month
		AWS Lambda function 	- not used in this product. used only in Monthly auto update on AWS 

		
	b. note that the on-demand date output dir for the tools - website_yyyymmdd - does not exist prior to processing. It will be created by the scripts in the same parent dir.

1. Update the config file - \root\transitanalystisrael_config.py 
	a. remove "#" from the "On demand date on local pc no TTM" to un-comment parameters to look as below:

#On demand date on local pc
get_service_date = 'on_demand'
python_processing = 'local_pc'
ttm_graph_processing = 'local_pc'
web_client_hosted_on = 'local_pc'
ttm_server_on = 'local_pc'

	b. make sure all the rest of the 6 product processing configurations are commented out - have "#"in the first char of the line.

	c. change "gtfsdate" and "serviceweekstartdate" to the requested on-demand date e.g. for 20190302 

gtfsdate = '20190302'
serviceweekstartdate = '20190302'

	d. save the config file

2. Download or copy the GTFS zip file, unzip, rename dir and place in /gtfs/ directory
	a. Locate GTFS files that corespond to a service start date that is equal to the on-demand date. Remeber that GTFS is uploaded to MOT servers (ftp://gtfs.mot.gov.il) at 10pm each day with a service start date of the next day. 
	b. Download or copy the GTFS zip file
	c. unzip the file 
	d. rename the dir of unzipped GTFS files to be gtfsdirbase+gtfsdate (as in the config file) e.g. 'israel20190302'
	e. place the renamed dir in the /gtfs/ directory e.g. C:\git\TransitAnalystIsrael\gtfs\israel20190302

3. Download or copy the Open Street Map - OSM file, and place in /osm/ directory
	a. Locate the current or recent Israel OSM file or one that coresponds to the on-demand date. download from  http://download.geofabrik.de/asia/israel-and-palestine.html
	b. Download or copy the OSM file - israel-and-palestine-latest.osm.pbf
	c. place the file in the /osm/ directory e.g. C:\git\TransitAnalystIsrael\osm\israel-and-palestine-latest.osm.pbf
	
4. Run the Navitia docker environment
	a. Run the Docker Desktop for Windows application and wait for it to come up.
	b. Go to the folder where you cloned the Navitia-docker-compose repo e.g. C:\git\navitia-docker-compose
	c. Right-click and select run "Git Bash" to open a terminal window.
	d. type at the prompt "docker-compose up"
		$ docker-compose up

	b. type "cmd" in the bar on top to open a cmd terminal
	c. at the prompt type 'python3 transitanalystisrael_v1' e.g. C:\git\TransitAnalystIsrael\root>python3 transitanalystisrael_v1

6. Wait about 4.5 hours for the scripts to run to completion

7. Run the TransitAnalystIsrael
	a. open a window in the websitelocalondemandpath (as in the config file) e.g. C:\git\TransitAnalystIsrael\website_20190302
